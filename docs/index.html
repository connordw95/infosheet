    <h1> Welcome to eQuip, </h1>
    <h2> The outdoor equipment sharing app.</h2>
    <h4 class="above">
      The current page you are on is not the actual application, but the info
      page for the beta that will be coming soon.
    </h4>
    <h4 class="above">
      eQuip is an app that will enable you to use your outdoor equipment
      such as kayaks, canoes, bikes, etc. to make money for you by
      renting them out to others. The goal of eQuip is to get people
      out into the outdoors to enjoy what this marvelous country has to
      offer. eQuip will allow those who were previously unable to
      take part in some of the more costly outdoor activities
      to do so by minimizing the initial cost and allowing them to
      simply use the equipment when they need to without the costly investment.
    </h4>

<h3> Equip will allow the users to list the following types of equipment for rent:</h3>
<ul>
<li> Kayaks </li>
<li> Canoes </li>
<li> Paddle/Surf Boards </li>
<li> Bicycles (road, mountain, and cruiser)</li>
<li> Tents </li>
<li> Backpacks (both stocked and bare) </li>
<li> Hammocks </li>
<li> Disc Golf Gear </li>
</ul>
<h4>
<p> Users will set their own prices but will have price limits but no minimums leaving the market to shape the pricing structure. Our limits are not to limit the amount you can make but to make sure we keep our goal of being a more affordable option for our users to take part in the outdoors. </p>
<p> We are limiting what users can list at anything without a motor and no projectiles. This will allow us to keep the costs low by minimizing the liability and possibility for harm. </p>
<p> Upon signing up you will pay a $5 fee to help cover your equipment from any possible damages while in possesion of others. </p>
<p> If the equipment being rented out requires safety equipment by state law, the user will need to assure the renter has it by either providing it to them or the renter proves they have it. </p>
<p> Renters will have the option to purchase insurance upon selecting which equipment to use. If they select insurance and damage happens eQuip will cover the cost. However, if they dont they will be responsible for the damages. Being we will have their card info, the process will go as so. You get the repairs done, send an invoice to eQuip, they will be charged the full price and it will be added to your account. </p>
